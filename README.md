 Privacy-First Adaptive Learning System

 Engagement Without Surveillance

A lightweight web app that improves student focus using voluntary attention check-ins and adaptive content delivery, while preserving complete privacy.


---

 Problem

Online learning often suffers from low engagement:

Students lose focus due to digital distractions

Teachers lack real-time attention insights

Existing tools rely on invasive tracking (camera, eye tracking)

Privacy concerns are increasing


 There is no privacy-safe system that adapts content when students lose focus.


---

 Solution

Our system:

✔ collects voluntary focus check-ins
✔ detects engagement drops using non-invasive signals
✔ adapts learning content in real time
✔ provides anonymized teacher insights
✔ offers Focus Mode for distraction-free learning
